StreamCart: Live Streams That Sell Themselves

Are you tired of posting products that ghosts your feed? StreamCart is the app that turns your phone's live video (Instagram, TikTok-style) into a non-stop sales show—tag items mid-stream, let viewers tap to cart and watch impulse buys roll in. No pro gear required, no tech headaches. Just you, your stuff and real-time revenue.

## What It Does
- **Quick Inventory Sync**: Pull products from Google Sheets or Shopify—auto-generate tags with prices, sizes and AR previews.
- **Live Sell Mode**: Hit "Go Live," overlay draggable badges on your video (e.g., "Tap for Red Dress - Size 8"). Voice-scan for instant tagging.
- **Seamless Checkout**: Viewers swipe to buy via Sellar—no app switch. Post-stream recaps email receipts and upsell highlights.
- **Sales Dash**: Track views-to-carts (e.g. "10-min stream = N32,000 in mugs") with simple charts.

## Why It Matters
Small businesses drown in low-engagement posts (10% views buy? No). Live video crushes it at 30x engagement but tagging is a buried hassle in creator tools. StreamCart unmasks that API magic for solos—demo a coffee pour-over, tag blends, close 4 sales in 10 mins (real test: N45,000 from 12 viewers). It is impulse gold: Catches scrollers in the moment, 10x faster than static shops.

## Who Is It For
- Individual sellers, boutiques, cafes and businesses hustling on social media (you with 1K followers dreaming of real sales).
- Non-techy creators ditching clunky APIs for one-tap lives.
- Brands wanting live's trust boost without the setup sweat.

## Key Features & Technologies
- **Core Hooks**: Real-time tagging, voice-to-tag (built-in phone AI), guest checkouts.
- **Easy Peasy**: No-code start (Adalo proto), free APIs for scale.
- **Tech Stack**: React Native for cross-app streams (iOS/Android), Node.js backend for Sellar/Zapier syncs, Instagram Graph/TikTok Shop APIs for live embeds.
- **Vibes**: Clean UI with stream overlays—feels like your fave live, but with carts.

Go live, tag, sell—your scroll just became a storefront!
